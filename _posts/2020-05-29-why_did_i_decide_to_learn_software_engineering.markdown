There's a scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade where Jr. ("we named the dog Indiana") has to make a Leap of Faith and step confidently out into what looks to be a chasm, almost certainly leading to his immediate demise. The scene struck a chord with me. And, it represents for me a position I would be in when choosing to try software engineering. Do I take a leap of faith in myself in the hopes for something better? Or, did I miss my moment? 

For a long time, I've been doing graphic design. I was getting by but barely. As years ticked by I stuck with it but things were getting more and more difficult. It was frustrating and quite honestly undermining my identity, my confidence and my mental health. I came to the decision it was time I did something else. But what? I considered software engineering but I'd be lying if I said those little voices in my head weren't holding me back. Then a little proverb popped into my radar and made a huge difference.

A little background. Programming isn't new to me. In college I took classes in Pascal, Cobal and Fortran. It was interesting but a little dry. At the time most of the "results"  of my time with programming were little more than reams of dot matrix paper with line after line of code. Intellectually challenging sure but it honestly wasn't visually satisfying. Yay, I made a stack of paper! By contrast coding these days seems so much more appealing. The results more visible, more viable. I could create an effective web site, or a helpful app or even an amusing game. THAT is so much better than a stack of paper. I can get jazzed about making that! 

Recently, too, I've been testing out the arena of programming again. As a designer I had to work through CSS and HTML. I was familiar with some of the features...enough to get by. I tried my hand at C++, Swift and most recently Python. So the programmer bug was obviously still with me. Maybe it was just me trying to prove I could still do it. Maybe it was a calling. Who knows. The point being that I was consciously or unconsciously keeping that part of my brain simmering.  

So back to my decision. I felt a little like Indiana Jones (just go with it) standing at a chasm on my future. What if I'm not smart enough? What if I fail? What if...what if I am too old to start? And that's where the proverb comes in...The first best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is RIGHT NOW! And so, that did it for me. It made so much sense. I couldn't go back 20 years ago. My only option is now. I won't know what will happen unless I try it. Sure, it could be a mess but the tools are abundant. And heck if I manage to pull this off the things I can do are so much more interesting these days. So, why did I decide to go for it? Part of it had to do with how difficult life was getting in my career and I definitely need to do something as a fix. But there's also an undeniable aspect that is about believing in myself, taking a risk on myself that I can do this. I had to take that step into the unknown and confidently believe my foot would hit solid ground.
